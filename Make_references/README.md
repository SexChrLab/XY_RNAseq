This project and the corresponding paper steamed from another project in the lab. The first project that looked at aligning DNA sequences to a reference genome informed on the sex chromosome complement. The GRCh38.p12.genomeXYonly.fa and GRCh38.p12.genomeXXonly.fa were made following that pipeline described here:
